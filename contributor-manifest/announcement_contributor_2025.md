# 📣 Welcome to the AFI Protocol

Agentic Financial Intelligence isn’t just a protocol — it’s a movement.

This is your invitation to contribute to one of the most ambitious open-source projects in modern finance.

## 🧭 What’s Happening?

We’ve officially launched our **Contributor Manifest**, including:

- 🧠 Mentorship Archetypes
- 🗂️ Working Groups & Contribution Pathways
- 🔍 Open Signal Validator Interfaces
- 📜 Governance, Licensing, and Manifest Philosophy

This is more than a spec. It’s a call to agency.

## 🛠️ What You Can Do

- Explore the `afi-protocol` repo (our meta-repo)  
- Review the `contributor-manifest/` folder for onboarding materials  
- Join us on Discord for contributor onboarding and labs access  
- Fork one of the modular repos to begin your build journey

## 🚀 Bonus: Remix the Archetypes

Have your own mentor archetype? Remix and submit one. We’re opening up the **mentor registry** for new personas and utility behaviors.  
The best contributions will be featured in upcoming lore scrolls.
