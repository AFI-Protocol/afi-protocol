# Onboarding for New Contributors

1. **Read this folder’s `README.md`** to understand AFI’s ethos.
2. **Pick a Working Group** or focus area that fits your skills.
3. **Fork a public repo** to get started  
   *Recommended first stops:*  
   - [`afi-core`](https://github.com/AFI-Protocol/afi-core) – scoring logic & consensus  
   - [`afi-docs`](https://github.com/AFI-Protocol/afi-docs) – spec & white-paper source  
   - [`afi-agents`](https://github.com/AFI-Protocol/afi-agents) – agent configs & runtime
4. **Need bleeding-edge access?**  
   The `afi-labs` repo hosts experimental code and is **private**.  
   Request access in Discord (`#labs-access`) once you’ve made an initial PR or proposal.
5. Join Discord for early alpha builds, schema previews, and working-group calls.
