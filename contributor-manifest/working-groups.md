# Working Groups (WGs)

AFI organizes contributors into lightweight, purpose-driven working groups:

- **Core Protocol** – specs, pipelines, consensus
- **Mentor & Agent Design** – personality kernels, archetypes, recovery models
- **UI/UX** – dashboards, validators, signal journals
- **Infra/Deployments** – Docker, Vercel, Terraform, Modal
- **Community Ops** – hackathons, governance, onboarding

Each WG can use a repo label (e.g. `WG:core`) to coordinate work async.
